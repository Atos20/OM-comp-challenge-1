# OM-comp-challenge-1
###
OM comp challenge-1 is the first solo project that I finished using HTML and CSS to replicate a webpage. This challenge focused strictly on practicing HTML and CSS languages as well as building a website layout based strictly on an image provided by Turing's instructors. This project challenges the use of layout systems such as CSS grid and flexbox and required an understanding of wireframing to define the website's structure. 

## Project Status
###
The static comp challenge looks like it is based on a webpage structure that focuses on providing data about individuals who appeared on what seems to be an informational card.

This project has been adapted to meet the requirements of an animal hospital that provides care for small house pets. The website's structure was designed with users in mind. To better understand the needs of the users it was  important to talk to potential users as well as with the veterinarians who provide these services.


## Webite Screengrabs

Navigation bar:
This section of the webpages holds the about, services, appointments, and log-in button. Here I have decided to make use of a single icon in the log-in button instead of using icons on the rest of the buttons to keep the design more minimalistic.

Right after the navigation bar, we can identify the patient's title that defines where the user is located in the website.

On the body of the page, the user can look at the current patient and identify a specific pet what might be under special care or undergoing a specific treatment.
